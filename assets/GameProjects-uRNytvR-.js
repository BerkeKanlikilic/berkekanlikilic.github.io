      <strong>Hide and Don't Die</strong> is a competitive multiplayer game where one player is randomly selected as <strong>The Chosen</strong> and must catch others before time runs out. However, they can only catch players if the <strong>Golden Ball</strong> is secured at its starting place. 
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph">
      Normal players must survive and sabotage The Chosen by moving the ball back to the end of a tunnel. This creates a fast-paced cycle of <strong>chasing</strong>, <strong>retrieving the ball</strong>, and <strong>strategic sabotage</strong>.
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph">
      Players can set custom usernames, create or join lobbies, and adjust game settings before starting a match.

      In this chaotic and satirical strategy game, you sit in a spinning chair, juggling three screens and a mission:<br/>
      <strong>Buy every last coffee bean on Earth</strong>.
    </div>
  
    <div class="paragraph">
      One screen tracks the volatile <strong>crypto markets</strong>, another lets you <strong>engineer and monetize a global virus</strong> (yes, while also selling the cure), and the third gives you the power to <strong>purchase entire continents</strong>. Why? Because Big Bean wants coffee, and nothing will stand in the way.

    <div class="paragraph">
      Built solo in just <strong>12 hours</strong> during a 72-hour game jam (while moving countries), this project was a crash course in <strong>rapid prototyping</strong>, <strong>UI juggling</strong>, and letting wild ideas fly. Everything—from mechanics to art—is original, except the music (royalty-free).

      <strong>The Last Faith</strong> is a UI-driven simulation game developed as part of an academic project focused on climate change. You play as an AI system tasked with <strong>saving Nottingham from ecological collapse</strong>. Each week, you allocate limited processing power to tasks — from researching renewable energy to improving waste systems.
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph">
      Every decision shapes your progress: tasks reward you with more processing power, research points, and unlocks. You'll need to strategically plan your upgrades and fulfill various <strong>UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)</strong> to succeed.
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph">
      Developed entirely in 2D UI, the game replicates the interface of a futuristic AI console, encouraging players to think critically about <strong>resource allocation</strong>, optimization, and sustainability — all through a serious-game lens.
