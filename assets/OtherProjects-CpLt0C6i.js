        I made this project for my University assignment, it is a simple little shell program that let's the user do multiple things such as making new users, classifying users and similar functionalities. It also has some inbuilt and external commands that have their resemblance to a Linux shell.
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph">
        It is a linux based application, so make sure to run it on a linux machine, since some of the functionalities won't work on other OSs.
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph">
        Running the code: Fork the project, download the code and maske sure to use a .csv file to store the user info in the following format <user,pass,boolean>
